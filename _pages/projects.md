Automatic Speech Reognition and Keyword Spotting in Continous Speech
---
Some of the research statements we seek to address in this project, include:-
* Can we do reliable speech recognition on noisy multilingual data?
* Can we introduce an efficent keyword-spotting system which not only gives accurate 
results but also takes a small amount of time, suitable for real-time applications?
* Can we overcome the large training data restrictions usually required for producing reliable keyword spotting results?
