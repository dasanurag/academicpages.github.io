Hi, I'm Anurag, currently working as a Project Assistant in [SPIRE Lab](http://spire.ee.iisc.ac.in/) in the Electrical Engineering Department of [Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore](http://iisc.ac.in/). I'm working under the supervision of [Dr. Prasanta Kumar Ghosh](http://www.ee.iisc.ac.in/people/faculty/prasantg/) on problems related to Automatic Speech Recognition and Keyword Spotting. During this time, I have used Kaldi, an Open-Source Speech Recognition Toolkit to create acoustic models trained on several well-known datasets. 

I graduated in Electronics and Communication Engineering from [NIT Silchar](http://www.nits.ac.in/), 2016 with GPA of 8.91(out of 10) and a department rank of 8. I'm interested in the areas of **speech recognition with noisy or unclean data, image forensics, computer vision, human computer interaction and Biomedical Signal Processing**. I'm particularly interested in applied machine learning research in different problems of Signal Processing.

I have also worked in [Idea Cellular Limited](http://www.ideacellular.com/), as a BSS Engineer. Some of my key roles included 
ensuring seamless performance of all 2G and 3G sites, installing new and upgrading existing microwave links between sites and ensuring all site related outages are dealt with at the earliest.
